# Fightstick-Viewer
A personal project using pygame to detect inputs of a fightstick and output to a GUI.

The code was derived off of the backbone of an example code of pygame's docs on the joystick module at https://www.pygame.org/docs/ref/joystick.html

The basis of the GUI is based off of the GUI of the fighstick input viewer from https://gamepadviewer.com/

This is purely a personal project. There are definitely better input viewers out there, but this is mainly for me to learn about Python and pygame, and push personal features for my own use. If this program benefits you in any way, feel free to download and use on your own.

To install, just download the Fightstick_Viewer.py and double click to run the script. You will need Python 3 and pygame installed on your own computer.

# Planned features:
1) Add a remapper, where you will be able to select which button will light up which circle
2) Add support for Hitbox/All-Button style controllers, add the ability to switch between viewers either through seperate program or through a button
3) Add a seperate program to support Frame1/Smash All-Button controllers, using similar things learned from the initial program
